## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My Project Idea is for a gallery webesite where people can browse the different artwork of various artists, see where they have showings at currently, future events the artist will be vending at, as well as a shopping cart setup for buying art through the website. Artists will be able to login and update their pages as one kind of user. Potential Customers will login as a different user to use the checkout features. This is useful over other apps for art such as Etsy in that it allows the user to connect more with the artist by knowing what galleries are showing their work and where they are publically vending vs just buying through a screen. I came up with this idea while on my own journey as an artist getting asked where I'm vending, showing my art, and how to go about buying some of my work.
